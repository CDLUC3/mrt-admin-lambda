audit_status:

  breadcrumb: bp_audit
  class: AuditStatusQuery
  category: audit
  description: |
    Count the number of files with an irregular audit status.  

    - For status `unknown` and `processing`, no action is generally required.  These states indicate that an item is being processed.
    - For status `system-unavailable` or `unverified`, a retry is generally recommended.
    - A status of `size-mismatch` or `digest-mismatch` indicates that either a copy error occurred or this could show evidence of bit rot.  Immediate investigation is required.
    - Files with a status of `verified` are explicitly excluded from this report for performance reasons.
audit_status_time:
  link-title: Audit Status - Recent Processing
  breadcrumb: bp_audit
  class: AuditStatusTimeQuery
  category: audit
  description: |
    This report identifies the number of files that have been processed by the audit service in the last hour or minute.
    Note: the audit service performs database updates in batches, so these number will tend to be reported in multiples of 248 records.
    #### Consider retiring this report in favor of other existing reports.
audit_oldest:

  breadcrumb: bp_audit
  class: AuditOldestQuery

  description: |
    Identify the oldest previously audited file in the inventory database.
    - If less than 60 days old, PASS
    - If 60-90 days old, WARN.  Consider adding capacity to the audit service.
    - If more than 90 days, ERROR.  The system is not meeting expectations for active fixity checking.
audit_size:
  link-title: Audit - Size of Queue
  breadcrumb: bp_audit
  class: AuditQueueSizeQuery
  category: audit
  description: |
    This report shows the size of the audit queue.  Since the audit service performs database updates to 496 records at a time, 
    the entries in this report will generally be multiples of 248.  If the audit service is not gracefully shutdown, old queue entries will be reported.
    Once these entries are older than 10 hours old, an error will be reported.
    The collection admin tool has an action defined to clear old queue entries from the database.
audit_processed_size:
  link-title: Audit - Historical Audits Processed Over Time
  breadcrumb: bp_audit
  class: AuditProcessedSizeQuery
  category: audit
  description: |
    Report on the number of files/bytes audited each day for the past 30-90 days.
    This report uses aggregate data from the billing database which is computed on a daily basis.
    This report will attempt to identify any significant degredation in performance from the audit service over the prior 6 day period.
    Performance issues older than 6 days are ignored by the report.

    - *WARN*: 
      - Replication started more than 4 hours ago.
    - *PASS*:

    The Merritt system typically has one primary copy of an object and 2 secondary copies.

    Files with only 1 or 2 copies likely indicate that replication is in progress or replication failed for the object.
    Files with more than 3 copies could indicate a misconfiguration of storage nodes for a collection.
