  description: |
    Count the number of files with an irregular audit status.  

    - For status `unknown` and `processing`, no action is generally required.  These states indicate that an item is being processed.
    - For status `system-unavailable` or `unverified`, a retry is generally recommended.
    - A status of `size-mismatch` or `digest-mismatch` indicates that either a copy error occurred or this could show evidence of bit rot.  Immediate investigation is required.
    - Files with a status of `verified` are explicitly excluded from this report for performance reasons.

  category: audit
  description: |
    This report identifies the number of files that have been processed by the audit service in the last hour or minute.

    the entries in this report will generally be multiples of 248.  If the audit service is not gracefully shutdown, old queue entries will be reported.
    Once these entries are older than 10 hours old, an error will be reported.
    The collection admin tool has an action defined to clear old queue entries from the database.

    This report uses aggregate data from the billing database which is computed on a daily basis.
    This report will attempt to identify any significant degredation in performance from the audit service over the prior 6 day period.
    Performance issues older than 6 days are ignored by the report.

    Given an object id, list the versions/files for the object.
    For each file, list the nodes where the object has been replicated.
    For each replication, list any instances in which the audit process has not been successful.

    Due to lambda resource constraints, a maximum of 2,000 files will be listed.

    - If less than equal to 3 days, the values will be graphed hourly 
    - If less than or equal to 14 days, the values will be graphed in 4 hour increments
    - If more than 14 days, the values will be graphed daily
    - the default is the most recent 7 days
    - ranges over 100 days will not be graphed.  The data retrieval is too slow for ranges that large.
